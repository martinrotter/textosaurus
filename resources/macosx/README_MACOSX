Textosaurus is automatically compiled for Mac OS X in a form of zipped Textosaurus.app package. Unfortunately, I am not skilled in creating Mac OS X bundles, so zipped app package have to be enough.

The package depends on homebrew/qt5 package which must be installed and linked. Execute these:

  brew install qt5
  brew link --force qt5
